Gentoos are curious and clever, often seen building intricate nests with pebbles and sometimes stealing them from their neighbors.",

Found on rugged islands in the Southern Ocean, they live in large colonies and are constantly chatting, squawking, and waddling around with attitude. Fierce and feathery, they’re born entertainers."
